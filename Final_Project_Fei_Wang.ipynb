    "The issue of the world's fresh-water consumption has been traditionally studied only at a national level based on a basic principle of national demand is less than or equal to the national supply. But recent studies by Prof. Arjen Hoekstra et al. [1-3] showed that through international trade of products, countries have transferred vast amount of freshwater consumption responsibility to other countries which might be less water resource abundant or with less efficient water usage technology. So, the amount of freshwater usage a country should be accountable for is the water usage due to the production of the products that a country’s inhabitants consumed, instead of just the water usage during a country’s production process. \n",
    "\n",
    "To study the issue of freshwater consumption within a global context, Prof. Arjen Hoekstra coined the term \"Water Footprint\" (WF), which extended the traditional definition of water usage by incorporating new dimensions like time, location, water type etc. Furthermore, the WF framework also separate water usage in different sectors (crop, animal, industrial, direct consumption) and types of freshwater consumed:\n",

    " - Green – rainfall water consumed\n",

    "The WF of an individual is defined as the Freshwater usage during the production process of all the products this person consumes, and the WF of a country is the sum of WFs of all its inhabitants. However, through the global trade of products, countries can transfer water consumption accross borders, hence the global flow of virtual water. In a simplified model of world trade with only 2 countries A and B, graph shown below [4], we can see the difference between \"Water Footprint of national consumption\" -- the amount of freshwater consumption a country should be responsible for, and \"Water Footprint within the nation\", the traditional metric for a country's water usage which excludes the external component of a country's water consumption.

    "With the establishment of the Water Footprint Network, the general public can get access to numerous studies [1-3] on global water consumption over the last decade and see the vast imbalance of water usage among the world. But the study results are mostly presented via a form of exploratory analyses, indicating key areas of extreme water footprint imbalance or the water resource scarcity.

In other words, are the developed countries polluting water resources of the developing countries?\n",

    "First, I looked at the distribution of virtual water import amounts by countries. As shown in the graph on the lower left, USA is the country with largest amount of import, far above the second tier countries like Japan, China, Frances etc., assuming more than 10% of global total. In the lower right chart, the top 4 countries by virtual water import are also those with large volumes of imported goods, whereas the 5th place country Italy, is not famous for its large size of economy. My hypothesis is that this is due to the country's heavy production of leather goods, which are highly water-intensive."

    "Second, when looking at the virtual export of blue water (surface and ground water), I found Pakistan stood out as a top country whose size of export is comparable to that of the USA. After drilling down to the product types associated with Pakistan's export of blue water, I found it's mostly from the crop products, which is even more surprising because typically crop production rely on the usage of green (rainfall) water. My hypothesis is that due to the country's climate condition and low precipitation, the crop production in Pakistan heavily rely on the ground or surface water. Also the relatively low efficiency of the country's irrigation system may also contributed to the large volume of water usage."

    "Third, I applied a statisitcal control method to detect the outliers of countries with high WF-Per-Capita. Countries whose WF-Per-Capita fall beyond 2 standard deviations of all countries are (from high to low): Mongolia, Niger, Bolivia, Brunei Darussalam, United Arab Erimates, Bermuda and USA. All except the USA are countries of small population, which typically can be biased in per-capita analysis. This suggests the living style of people in the USA are highly water-intensive, probably ranked as the highest among all the countries with large population. This raises an alarm because we know USA ranks at top 3 in both aggregated virtual water import and export and total WF also. We can also hypothesize that the high WF-per-capita of Mongolia is due to the meat-oriented diet of its people and for Brunei and UAE are due to their high standard of living. I am not sure about the reasons for Niger, Bolivia and Bermuda being on the top ones but there could be other contextual information I am not aware of."

    "Through global trade countries not only transfer the liability of freshwater usage, but also water pollution. The latter is of more serious concern since it requires additional effort from the grey water (polluted water generated during production processes) exporting countries, the exporter of products, to deal with the pollution. In this RQ I applied a T-test of unequal variances to check the percentages of exported grey water in total WF per capita among developed countries and those of the developping countries. The result is statistically significant, evidencing the fact that the transfer of water pollution is mostly directional, from developed world to the developing countries whose economy is geared towards the high-pollution industrial sector for exports.

    "There are a few limitations in this study, mainly related to the datasets.\n",

    " - First, since the data on global WF by country are annual average amounts of years 1996 – 2005, I was not able to present any trend of WF changes by country. There are countries that experienced significant economic and societal changes during this time frame and thus could have dramatical change in their water usage. \n",
    "\n",
    " - Second, I was not able to connect the water usage data with water scarcity data. Prof. Arjen Hoesktra did provide data of water scarcity on world's major river basins, but since many river basins are international, it's hard to tie that with the WF data by country.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Third, the dataset is not quite up-to-date (1996 - 2005), but the process of acquiring new data on this topic is tedious and involves data retrieval from multiple data sources of very diverse designs, assumptions and ways to quantify and handle uncertainties.\n",

    "\n",
    "To reduce the global freshwater consumption in aggregate, not only do water policy decision makers need to put their water consumption within a global context, also they need to adopt a more holistic view by considering of the interaction between one country's water policy and policies in related sectors like energy, trade, technology, agriculture and so on. At the individual level, the public should be more informed with the diversity of water intensity among all the products they consume every day."
