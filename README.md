### Project Plan

The issue of the world\'s fresshwater consumption has been tradititonally studied only at a national level based on a basic principle of national demand is less than 
or equal to the national supply. But recently studies by Prof. Arjen Hoekstra shows that to reduce the global freshwater consumption in aggregate, not only 
do water policy decision makers need to consider their water consumption within a global context, they also need to take a more holistic view by taking into account of 
the interaction between one country\'s water policy and policies in other sectors like energy, trade, agriculture and so on. At the individual level, the general public
should be more informed with the diversity of water intensity among all the products they consume each day. To study the issue of freshwater consumption within a global 
context, Prof. Arjen Hoekstra coined the term \"Water Footprint\", which extended the traditional definition of water usage by incorporating new dimentions of water usage
like time, location, water_type etc.
