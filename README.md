# The Need For Balanced Global Freshwater Usage
Final Project of DATA 512 - Human Centered Data Science of the M.S. Program in Data Science, UW

Abstract:
The objective of this project is to illustrate the issue of imbalanced water consumption in the world and raise the awareness and conscience of public to take actions on a more sustainable water consumption pattern. Under the framework of Global Water Footprint, I formulated research questions to study how the global flow of freshwater resources was distributed and whether the transfer of water resources and pollutions was fair between the developed and developing countries. The data and visualizations show that there is indeed a hugely imbalanced distribution of global water usage and transfer, and the freshwater usage of a country not only depend on the volume of aggregated consumption, but also the water intensity of its inhabitants' consumption pattern, and the water scarcity and technology of water usage of its trading partners. As a result, to reduce the global freshwater consumption, not only do water policy decision makers need to put their water consumption within a global context, also they need to adopt a more holistic view by considering of the interaction between one country's water policy and policies in related sectors like energy, trade, technology, agriculture and so on. At the individual level, the public should be more informed with the diversity of water intensity among all the products they consume every day.
