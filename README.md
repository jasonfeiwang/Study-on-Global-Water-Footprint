# data-512-Final Project

The objective of this project is to illustrate the problem of imbalanced water consumption among the world and raise the awareness and conscience of public to take actions on a more sustainable water consumption pattern.

### Research Questions

- RQ 1: Are the global flow of virtual water and WF-Per-Capita distributed evenly?
- RQ 2: How much variance of the Water Footprint per-capita can be explained by the difference in standard of living of different countries?
- RQ 3: Are the developed countries transferring water pollution to the developing world? 

### Conclusions

Through this study I cnofirmed the issue of imbalanced and unsustainable distribution of global freshwater usage. As Prof. Arjen Hoekstra pointed out, the freshwater usage of a country not only depend on the volume of aggregated consumption, but also the water intensity of its inhabitants' consumption pattern, and the water scarcity and technology of water usage of its trading partners.

To reduce the global freshwater consumption in aggregate, not only do water policy decision makers need to put their water consumption within a global context, also they need to adopt a more holistic view by considering of the interaction between one country's water policy and policies in related sectors like energy, trade, technology, agriculture and so on. At the individual level, the public should be more informed with the diversity of water intensity among all the products they consume every day.
